This is the GitHub repository for this project I made for showing _Charts_ and _Graphs_ using **[NG2-Charts](https://valor-software.com/ng2-charts/)**

It also shows a *Doughnut Chart* which takes the data through *HTTP Request* from a *JSON DataBase* using **RXJS Operators**.

Right now is **still on development** and isn't deployed.
