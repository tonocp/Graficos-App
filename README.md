# GraficosApp

This is the GitHub repository for this project I made for showing _Charts_ and _Graphs_ using **[NG2-Charts](https://valor-software.com/ng2-charts/)**

It also shows a _Doughnut Chart_ which takes the data through _HTTP Request_ from a **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) Database** using **RXJS Operators**.

### Now it's deployed here: https://graficas-tcp.herokuapp.com/
